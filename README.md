# react-react-native

## Study repository with an app using react + react native

 ** The first version of the application includes tree solutions:

    - mobile: 
        -- mobile version of the Proffy application containing a landing page, a page for students to search for proffys and contact them directly via whatsapp.
        # Stack: 
            -- react-native
            -- axios
            -- typescript
            -- expo

    - server:
        -- An api that allow us to record classes, connections, schedules and users and query proffys by filtering their time availability.
        # Stack:
            -- knex
            -- typescript 
            -- express
            -- postgresql (on the rocketseat original class they used sqlite)
    
    - web: 
        -- The web version of the proffy app, here we can access a beautiful landing page, a page for "proffys" to record the classes they are offering, a page for students to search for proffys and contact them directly via whatsapp.
        # Stack:
            -- typescript
            -- react
            -- axios
